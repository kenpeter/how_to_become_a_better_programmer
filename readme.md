# Pomodoro technique
Pomodoro uses 25 minutes for a cycle and take 5 minutes as a break. I found that 25 minutes is too long. I set my timer
on phone for 10 minutes, then focus on the task. After 10 minutes, if I feels good, I will keep going for another 10 minutes.
If I stuck, I will go out for a walk. I found that 10 minutes is good for myself. e.g. If you get stuck in 10 minutes, you
have to call a timeout like basketbal, think about what you just did, what went wrong, ask yourself questions, ask why, do some review,
then go back and continue your task.

10 minutes can do lots of things if you are used to it. It may be hard at the start, but slowly you will be very fast.
